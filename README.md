## Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

> ✨ Click the badge at the top for one-click HACS installation, or follow these steps:

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Search for "Cheapest Energy Windows"
4. Click "Download"
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > "Add Integration"
7. Search for "Cheapest Energy Windows"
8. Follow the configuration wizard

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/cheapest_energy_windows` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Settings > Devices & Services

6. Follow the configuration wizard

### Docker Configuration Note

If running Home Assistant in Docker and using ENTSO-E sensors:
- Ensure your container has the `TZ` environment variable set (e.g., `TZ=Europe/Amsterdam`)
- Nord Pool works without this setting, but ENTSO-E requires proper timezone configuration
- Without this, ENTSO-E timestamps may show UTC (+00:00) instead of local timezone

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

During the configuration flow, you'll be asked to:

1. **Select your price sensor**: The integration will auto-discover Nord Pool and ENTSO-E price sensors in your Home Assistant instance

2. **Link Battery Operations** (optional):
   - Select existing automations, scripts, or scenes for each battery mode
   - The integration will automatically trigger these when entering each state
   - Can be configured later from the dashboard

3. **Choose window duration**:
   - **15 minutes** (96 windows per day) - Recommended if your energy contract supports quarter-hourly trading/settlement
   - **1 hour** (24 windows per day) - Simpler management, suitable for hourly contracts

   > **Tip**: Most Nord Pool data includes 15-minute granularity. Choose 15-minute windows for maximum optimization flexibility, or 1-hour windows for simpler scheduling.

4. **Configure pricing parameters**:
   - VAT percentage
   - Additional tax (€/kWh)
   - Fixed additional costs (€/kWh)

5. **Battery settings** (optional):
   - Charge power (Watts)
   - Discharge power (Watts)
   - Round-trip efficiency (%)

6. **PV forecast settings** (optional):
   - Enable/disable PV-aware optimization
   - Configure forecast sensors for remaining today and tomorrow
   - Configure battery capacity sensor and SOC target at sunrise
   - Optional winter reserve (minimum SOC + winter month list)

You can change the window duration anytime after setup using the `Pricing Window Duration` selector in the dashboard or entity settings.

### What Happens During Setup

1. **Guided Configuration Wizard** walks you through all settings
2. **Automatic Automation Creation** - A complete battery control automation is created
3. **Battery Operations Linking** - Optionally link your existing battery control
4. **Dashboard Ready** - All entities created and ready for the dashboard
5. **Notifications Configured** - Ready to alert you about state changes

## Dashboard Installation

The integration includes a comprehensive pre-built dashboard for monitoring and controlling all features. The dashboard is distributed as a **separate HACS package** that automatically updates whenever improvements are made.

   views: []
   ```
   - Click **"Save"**

**Benefits**: Automatic updates via HACS, no manual copying, always up-to-date with the latest improvements!

### Required Frontend Components

The dashboard requires the following custom cards to be installed via HACS:

1. **[Mushroom Cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom)** - Modern card designs
2. **[Fold Entity Row](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-fold-entity-row)** - Collapsible entity rows
3. **[ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card)** - Advanced chart rendering
4. **[Card Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)** - Card styling

To install these:
- Go to **HACS > Frontend**
- Search for each card name
- Click **Download** and restart Home Assistant

## How It Works

### Window Selection Algorithm

The algorithm operates on either **15-minute or 1-hour intervals** depending on your configuration:

1. **Data Processing**:
   - **15-minute mode**: Uses Nord Pool's quarter-hourly data directly (96 data points per day)
   - **1-hour mode**: Aggregates four 15-minute periods into hourly averages (24 data points per day)

2. **Percentile Filtering**:
   - Identifies the cheapest X% of windows for charging
   - Identifies the most expensive Y% of windows for discharging

3. **Progressive Selection**:
   - Starts with most extreme prices
   - Adds windows while maintaining minimum spread requirements
   - Ensures profitability considering round-trip efficiency

4. **Spread Calculation**:
   ```
   Spread = ((expensive_price - cheap_price) / cheap_price) * 100
   ```

5. **State Determination**:
   - **Charge**: Current window is in cheap windows and spread requirement met
   - **Discharge**: Current window is in expensive windows and spread requirement met
   - **Discharge Aggressive**: Current window meets aggressive discharge spread
   - **Idle**: No conditions met
   - **Off**: Automation disabled

### PV Forecast Adjustment (V1)

When enabled, CEW adjusts the configured number of charging windows with a day-level PV energy estimate:

1. Compute required energy from current SOC to target SOC at sunrise.
2. Subtract forecast PV energy:
   - Today: `pv_forecast_remaining_today_sensor`
   - Tomorrow: `pv_forecast_tomorrow_sensor`
3. Apply optional winter reserve floor (minimum SOC in configured winter months).
4. Convert remaining required grid energy into charge windows.
5. Clamp the result to `0..configured_charge_windows`.

If required data is missing, CEW falls back safely to standard behavior and exposes `pv_fallback_reason` in sensor attributes.

### Entities Created

The integration creates a broad set of configuration entities (including dashboard compatibility aliases and PV settings):

#### Sensors
- `sensor.cew_today`: Current state and window information for today
- `sensor.cew_tomorrow`: Window information for tomorrow (when available)

- Spreads (minimum, discharge, aggressive)
- Costs (VAT, tax, additional)
- Battery parameters (power, efficiency)
- Price overrides
- Dashboard compatibility aliases (`percentile_threshold`, `min_profit_*`)
- PV settings (`soc_target_sunrise`, `winter_min_soc`)

#### Input Booleans
- Automation enable/disable
- Notification settings
- Time override enables
- Tomorrow settings
- PV optimization toggles (`pv_forecast_enabled`, `winter_reserve_enabled`)
- Dashboard compatibility toggles (`min_buy_price_diff_enabled`)

#### Input Selects
- Window duration mode
- Time override modes
- Price formula compatibility select
- PV source select

#### Input DateTimes (14)
- Time override periods
- Quiet hours

#### Input Text
- Price sensor entity ID

## Automation System

### 🚀 Fully Automated Battery Control

The integration provides a **complete, zero-configuration automation system**:

1. **Automatic Creation**: On installation, creates a fully-functional battery control automation
2. **Auto-Updates**: Automation is automatically updated with new features during integration upgrades
3. **Self-Healing**: Recreated if deleted, ensuring your battery control never breaks
4. **State-Based Control**: Responds to calculated energy windows and manual overrides

### 🔗 Battery Operations Linking

**NEW: Link your existing battery control without editing YAML!**

Simply select your battery control method during setup or from the dashboard:
- Link existing **automations** (e.g., `automation.charge_battery`)
- Link existing **scripts** (e.g., `script.set_battery_mode`)
- Link existing **scenes** (e.g., `scene.battery_discharge`)

The integration will automatically trigger your linked actions when entering each mode:
- **Idle** → Your idle automation/script/scene
- **Charge** → Your charging automation/script/scene
- **Discharge** → Your discharge automation/script/scene
- **Aggressive Discharge** → Your peak discharge automation/script/scene

### 📱 Intelligent Notifications

- **Per-State Configuration**: Enable/disable notifications for each battery state
- **Quiet Hours**: Set times when notifications are suppressed
- **Smart Alerts**: Notifies about price overrides, SOC safety blocks, and state changes
- **Automation Status**: Get alerts when automation is disabled or battery is off

### 🛡️ Battery Protection Features

- **SOC Safety Limits**: Prevents discharge below configurable thresholds
- **Dual SOC Thresholds**: Separate limits for normal and aggressive discharge
- **Automatic Mode Reversion**: Returns to idle when SOC limits are reached
- **Configuration Validation**: Alerts if SOC safety is misconfigured

### Manual Control (Advanced)

#### Step 1: Find Your Battery Control Entities

First, identify the entities that control your battery:
- Battery charge switch/number (e.g., `switch.battery_charge`, `number.battery_charge_power`)
- Battery discharge switch/number (e.g., `switch.battery_discharge`, `number.battery_discharge_power`)
- Battery mode select (e.g., `select.battery_mode`)

#### Step 2: Edit the Automations

1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes**
2. Find the automations created by CEW (look for "CEW" or "Cheapest Energy Windows" prefix)
3. Click on each automation to edit it
4. Add your battery control actions to the corresponding states

#### Step 3: Automation Examples

        data:
          title: "Today's Energy Windows"
          message: >
            Charging at: {{ state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'cheapest_times') | join(', ') }}
            Avg charge price: €{{ state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'avg_cheap_price') | round(3) }}/kWh

            Discharging at: {{ state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'expensive_times') | join(', ') }}
            Avg discharge price: €{{ state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'avg_expensive_price') | round(3) }}/kWh

            Spread: {{ state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'spread_percentage') }}%
            Net profit potential: €{{ (state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'avg_expensive_price') - state_attr('sensor.cew_today', 'avg_cheap_price')) | round(3) }}/kWh
```

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Safety First**: Always test your battery control automations carefully:
- Start with low power values
- Monitor the first few cycles manually
- Ensure your battery BMS has proper protections
- Check that charge/discharge commands work correctly

💡 **Customization**: Every battery system is different. The examples above are templates - you MUST adapt them to your specific battery controller's entities and requirements.

🔔 **Notifications**: Keep notification actions even after adding battery control - they help you monitor that everything is working as expected.

### Tomorrow Sensor Shows "Unavailable"

This is normal. Tomorrow's prices typically become available between 13:00-14:00 (varies by provider).

### Settings Not Rotating at Midnight

1. Ensure "Tomorrow Settings Enabled" is turned on
2. Check that automation is enabled
3. Verify Home Assistant time zone is correct

## Performance

The integration uses an optimized calculation engine with exceptional performance:

- **Update Interval**: 5 seconds - Fast response to state changes
- **Calculation Time**: Extremely fast (<10ms typical) thanks to NumPy optimization
- **Smart Caching**: Results are cached and only recalculated when prices or settings change
- **Efficient Architecture**:
  - Uses NumPy for vectorized array operations
  - Minimal overhead compared to template-based solutions
  - Handles both 15-minute (96 windows) and 1-hour (24 windows) modes efficiently
